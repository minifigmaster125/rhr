~~Log for changes~~

--November 16, 2012--
    Created this log to keep track of changes made to code, and to help us collaborate and understand it. -SSC

    Pulled new repository, checked authentication. I am good to go. -JSC

    Added 'thin' to gemfile. Bundle installed. Created Static_Controller, with home page in view. added that to routes as 'root' and 'match'.
    Still need to look into the routes to make sure I know what I'm doing. -SSC

    Checked out Gemfile, got thin. Checked home page. We have liftoff. -JSC

    Created sample outline with html file. Also made application.css into SASS
    and added compass import. Look under Notesf for outline image and html.
    -JSC

--November 19, 2012--
    Starting working on the header. Created the partial, added the links,
    created the red box with box-shadow. All in application.css.scss (because
    it applies to all pages -JSC

--November 20, 2012--
    Changed inline-block to #include for compass mixin -JSC

    Changed Gemfile: added gem 'sassy-buttons' under 'assets:', removed 'require'.
    We are trying to make this responsive, so working in ems and percents is the way to go. 
    Therefore, I changed the application.css.scss 'html { width' tag to be 100%, instead of 
    '960px'. All changes made to application.css.scss. Adjusted nav links using margins, 
    Joraaver should check on that. Also changed margins between links for lines later on. Used 
    '@include' tag from compass for vendor prefixes, for both border-radius and for linear gradient,
    with appropriate colors. -SSC

	Started work on "In Recent News" section. Requires image for
	horizontal line, but currently using bottom border. -JSC

    Added sticky footer using the compass mixin. Pretty easy, took about 15 minutes, gradient, 
    drop shadow, and all. -SSC

	Adjusted sticky footer with recent news stuff to fix conflicts.
	Had to fiddle with the layout in the application.html.erb file.

--November 23, 2012--

	Stylized header navigation bar links. Added lines in-between using border-right, and setting 
    padding on the right equal to margin for next link on the left (margin of first link should be 0).
    Also imported 'link-colors' and 'transitions' from compass to set the nav-bar to highlight when hovered. -SSC

	Finally got the fonts to work. Have to put them in a fonts
	folder, which the url automatically looks for when you
	specify a font. I also decreased the size of the header.
	-JSC

	Now, added text fonts and heading fonts. All readable and
	nice. -JSC

	Fixed fonts for IE (one wasn't showing up due to logic issues) -JSC

	Adjusted filter gradient for IE -JSC

    Stylized main logo font a little bit in header, as well as darkened the navbar links. Stylized Footer, 
    adding the FTC logo image and footer info in a list, -SSC

    Adjusted footer li padding is all. --SSC
   	
	Found out how to add pictures to slider. 
	Now working on JQuery aspect -JSC

--November 27, 2012--
	
	Found the magic--the Content Slider works (without
	navigation, but that's good still) -JSC

	Transferred stuff from JS in application.js to
	Coffeescript in static.js.coffee. Yippeee! -JSC

--November 28, 2012--

    Phew. After quite a struggle, I managed to figure out how to make the years slider work. Wonderful. 
    Also made sure it is is static.js.coffee as cofeescript. I actually understand the javascript now, and 
    I can see some pretty powerful applications. . . I also formatted the slider correctly. Now what's 
    left is adding pictures and replacing the "previous" and "next" buttons with arrows. --SSC

	Fixed formatting issue with page and slider height. -JSC

--December 12, 2012--

	Created mockup for brief history and contact. Well, technically, it
	includes all the page in an html format.
	Added home tab
	Made home tab and main "Red HoloRAMS" text link to root_path. Actual only
	functional piece of code! -JSC

--December 13, 2012--
	
	Whole brief history done page done, except for images if
	needed (which should be the case, looking a little bland)
