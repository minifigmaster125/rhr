    Created this log to keep track of changes made to code, and to help us collaborate and understand it. -SSC

    Pulled new repository, checked authentication. I am good to go. -JSC

    Added 'thin' to gemfile. Bundle installed. Created Static_Controller, with home page in view. added that to routes as 'root' and 'match'.
    Still need to look into the routes to make sure I know what I'm doing. -SSC

    Starting working on the header. Created the partial, added the links,
    created the red box with box-shadow. All in application.css.scss (because
    it applies to all pages -JSC

    Changed inline-block to #include for compass mixin -JSC

    Changed Gemfile: added gem 'sassy-buttons' under 'assets:', removed 'require'.
    We are trying to make this responsive, so working in ems and percents is the way to go. 
    Therefore, I changed the application.css.scss 'html { width' tag to be 100%, instead of 
    '960px'. All changes made to application.css.scss. Adjusted nav links using margins, 
    Joraaver should check on that. Also changed margins between links for lines later on. Used 
    '@include' tag from compass for vendor prefixes, for both border-radius and for linear gradient,
    with appropriate colors. -SSC
