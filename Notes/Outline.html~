<h2>3rd Place in Sequoia Qualifier!</h2>
<p>On November 11, 2012, we took 3rd place at the Sequoia qualifier. While we were immensely proud of our first feat as a almost entirely new team, the lack of any trophies showed how much room we had for improvement. Our robot design was outstanding--in fact, it carried us to 5th place(with Owen at the wheel), which eventually became 3rd due to an interesting series of alliance captain selections.</p>
