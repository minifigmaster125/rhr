    Created this log to keep track of changes made to code, and to help us collaborate and understand it. -SSC

    Pulled new repository, checked authentication. I am good to go. -JSC

    Added 'thin' to gemfile. Bundle installed. Created Static_Controller, with home page in view. added that to routes as 'root' and 'match'.
    Still need to look into the routes to make sure I know what I'm doing. -SSC

    Checked out Gemfile, got thin. Checked home page. We have liftoff. -JSC

    Created sample outline with html file. Also made application.css into SASS
    and added compass import. Look under Notesf for outline image and html.
    -JSC

    Starting working on the header. Created the partial, added the links,
    created the red box with box-shadow. All in application.css.scss (because
    it applies to all pages -JSC

    Changed inline-block to #include for compass mixin -JSC

    Changed Gemfile: added gem 'sassy-buttons' under 'assets:', removed 'require'.
    We are trying to make this responsive, so working in ems and percents is the way to go. 
    Therefore, I changed the application.css.scss 'html { width' tag to be 100%, instead of 
    '960px'. All changes made to application.css.scss. Adjusted nav links using margins, 
    Joraaver should check on that. Also changed margins between links for lines later on. Used 
    '@include' tag from compass for vendor prefixes, for both border-radius and for linear gradient,
    with appropriate colors. -SSC

	Started work on "In Recent News" section. Requires image for
	horizontal line, but currently using bottom border. -JSC

    Added sticky footer using the compass mixin. Pretty easy, took about 15 minutes, gradient, 
    drop shadow, and all. -SSC

	Adjusted sticky footer with recent news stuff to fix conflicts.
	Had to fiddle with the layout in the application.html.erb file.

	Finally got the fonts to work. Have to put them in a fonts
	folder, which the url automatically looks for when you
	specify a font. I also decreased the size of the header.

    Stylized header navigation bar links. Added lines in-between using border-right, and setting 
    padding on the right equal to margin for next link on the left (margin of first link should be 0).
    Also imported 'link-colors' and 'transitions' from compass to set the nav-bar to highlight when hovered. -SSC
